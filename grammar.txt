Examples:
define transition as @transition0: 5s slide_left
0: show image "my_image.png" at 100,200 for 5s as @character0 with transition @transition0
2: show text "Hello World" at 20,20 for 2s
show image "my_second_image.png" at 200,300 for 2s after @character0	# this statement has no time marker, but will appear after the transition of @character0
